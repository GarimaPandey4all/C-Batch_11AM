STL: Standard Template Library

Generic Programming->for different data types

STL: It is a powerful set of C++ template classes.

It has three well-structured components:

1. Containers

2. Algorithms

3. Iterators


Containers:

-Containers are used to manage collections of objects of a certain kind.

-container library in STL provide containers that are used to create data structures like arrays, linked list, trees etc.

-These containers are generic they can hold elements of any data types.

Example:

vector: vector can be used creating dynamic arrays of char , integer, float and other types.

Algorithms:

-Algortihms act on containers. They provide the means by which you will perform initialization, sorting, searching. and transforming of the contents of containers.

-Algorithms libraray containes built in functions that performs complex algorithms on the data structure.

Iterators: Repetition

-Iterators are used to step through the elements of collections of objects. These collections may be containers or subsets of containers.

-Iterators in STL are used to point to the containers.

-Iterators actually acts as a bridge b/w containers and algorithms.

STL Containers:

-container library is a collection of classes.

-The containers are implemented as generic class templates.

-containers help us to implement and replicate simple and complex data structures very easily like arrays, linked list, trees, associative arrays and many more.

-contianers can be used to hold different kind of objects

Stack S1;

S1.puch(10);
S1.pop();

->Common Containers:

vector: replicate arrays
queue: replicate queues
stack: replicate stack
priority Queue: replicate heaps
list : replicate linked list
set: trees
map: associative arrays

->classification of Containers:

-sequence container
like array, linked list, queue, etc

-Associative Containers:
sorted data structures like map, set etc

-unsorted associative containers:
unsorted data structures

-contianers adapters:
Interfaces to sequence containers

->How to use containers library?

1. header file
#include<list>

2. main()
list <int> mylist;


-->Array in STL:

-Array is a linear collection of similar elements.

-Array container in STL provides us the implementation od static array.

-Use header array: #include<array>

-array <int, 10> obj;

-array <object_type, array_size> array_name;

-array <int , 5> obj = {2, 4, 5, 8, 0};

#Member Functions: Array Template class

-at

This method returns value in the array at given range.

If the given range is greater than the array size, out of range exceptions is thrown.

-[] operator

-front(): First element of an array

-back(): Last element of an array

-fill(): This method assigh the given value to every element of an array.

-swap(): two arrays swap but when both array are of same type and same size.

-size()

-begin(): This method returns the iterator pointing to the first element of the array.

-end(): This method returs the iteratir pointing to the last element of the array.
